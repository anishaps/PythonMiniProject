As cooler temperatures arrive, so do world-famous American holidays such as Halloween and Thanksgiving. And autumn really shows off its colours in Central Park, where more than 26,000 resident trees start to shed their leaves. Strolling through the foliage wearing a scarf, drinking a pumpkin spice latte? That’s definitely one to share with your Facebook feed.")

Enjoy long days on the beach in hotspots like Sal and Boa Vista, and have a go at watersports like surfing and kayaking. Away from the beach, make the most of Cape Verde’s mixture of cultural influences from Africa and Portugal by tucking into national dish Cachupa, or some of the island’s fresh fish.")

You have four islands to choose from, including sleepy Formentera and party-central Majorca.

It has some of the finest beach hotels in the world, and you can find little boutique hotels right on the beach, too. Perhaps the best months to go to Mauritius are October and November, when it's hot but not too hot, and at its driest.")
